  <h1>Why electrical engineering is one of my passion?</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Being the brother of an electrical engineer working at PSA.I have seen images of the complex workings of quay cranes.This has shown me the middle ground between electrical engineering and computer engineering using my brother as an inspiration.This has drawn me into analyzing the complex systems of quay cranes which will eventually help  me look for points of convergence.</li>
